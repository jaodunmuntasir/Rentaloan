# Using the Project with External Hardhat Node

This project works with an externally running Hardhat node and manually deployed contracts.

## Prerequisites

1. Have Hardhat installed globally or in another project
2. Have contracts already deployed on a Hardhat node at the following addresses:
   - RentalAgreementFactory: 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3
   - LoanAgreementFactory: 0xe7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Start Hardhat Node Externally**
   Run the following command in a separate terminal with Hardhat installed:
   ```
   npx hardhat node
   ```
   This will start a local Hardhat blockchain at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

2. **Check Connection and Save Contract Addresses**
   With the Hardhat node running:
   ```
   npm run deploy:contracts
   ```
   This will check the connection to the Hardhat node and save the contract addresses to `config/contractAddresses.json`.

3. **Start the Application**
   Start both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes for Development

- The deployment script only checks that the Hardhat node is running and saves the contract addresses
- No verification of contract artifacts is performed, so contracts can be deployed from any source
- All blockchain transactions will be executed on the external Hardhat node

This checklist provides comprehensive documentation while prioritizing a simple but functional implementation, building on the components that are already in place and focusing on the core functionality needed for the application to work with a local Hardhat node.
