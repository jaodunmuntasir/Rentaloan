## 1. Introduction

The Blockchain-Based Rental Loan System represents a novel intersection between traditional rental agreements and decentralized finance. This documentation analyzes user interaction patterns and provides structured workflows for system engagement. Rather than serving as a simple instruction manual, this analysis examines the theoretical underpinnings of user interaction with blockchain-based financial applications and provides a methodological framework for system utilization.

The system architecture employs a client-server model with blockchain integration, requiring distinct interaction patterns for different user roles. This documentation categorizes these patterns according to stakeholder classification and task-oriented processes, providing both role-based and functionality-based analysis frameworks.
